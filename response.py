"difference between": ["""
The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu) infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing), good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good household cleaning are important actions to prevent both infections.

The speed of transmission is an important difference between the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.

While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms, approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5% require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for influenza infections
"""],
"most risk": ["""
Based on what we know so far about COVID-19 and what we know about other coronaviruses, those at greatest risk of serious infection are:
people aged 65 years and over
Aboriginal people (as they have higher rates of chronic illness)
people with chronic medical conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, neurological conditions and diabetes
people with impaired immune systems (such as people who have cancer or HIV, or who take high dose corticosteroids).
People living in group residential settings are at greater risk of being exposed to outbreaks of COVID-19 if a case is diagnosed in a resident or staff member. This includes:

people living in residential aged care facilities and disability group homes
people in detention facilities
students in boarding schools
people on Cruise Ships.
People living in some group residential settings are also more likely to have conditions that make them at greater risk of serious COVID-19 infection.
"""],
"Social distancing": ["""
Social distancing means we reduce the number of close physical and social contacts we have with one another.

When social distancing actions are combined with good personal hygiene measures the spread of a pandemic through the community can be slowed. This helps protect the most vulnerable members of the community and reduces the impact of the pandemic on essential, life-saving health services.

Social distancing is an effective measure, but it is recognised that it cannot be practised in all situations and the aim is to generally reduce potential for transmission.

While practising social distancing, people can travel to work (including public transport). For non-essential activities outside the workplace or attendance at schools, universities and childcare - social distancing includes:

avoiding crowds and mass gatherings where it is difficult to keep the appropriate distance away from others
avoiding small gatherings in enclosed spaces, for example family celebrations
attempting to keep a distance of 1.5 metres between themselves and other people where possible, for example when they are out and about in public place.
avoiding shaking hands, hugging, or kissing other people.
avoiding visiting vulnerable people, such as those in aged care facilities or hospitals, infants, or people with compromised immune systems due to illness or medical treatment.
